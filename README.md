# My Developer Blog

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), 
a modern static website generator.

## Repository Description

This repository hosts a developer blog built with Docusaurus. 
It includes tools and scripts for 
creating, managing, and deploying static web content. 
The software supports rapid local development, customizable theming
and seamless deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages or NGINX.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24 or later recommended)

1. Installation

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

2. Local Development

  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3. Build

  ```
  $ npm run build
  ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory 
and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

4. Deployment

    Pushing a commit to the main branch automatically triggers 
  the GitHub Actions workflow, which builds the site and deploys it 
  to GitHub Pages. See the [Deployment](#deployment) section for details.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

  - `blog/`: Contains markdown files for blog posts. Blog-related metadata 
is automatically picked up by the Docusaurus configuration.
  - `docs/`: Contains markdown files for documentation. 
These files are referenced in `sidebars.ts` to define the sidebar structure.
  - `src/`: Contains custom React components, CSS, and JavaScript 
for additional functionality or theming.
  - `static/`: Stores static assets (e.g., images, icons) 
served directly without processing.
  - `sidebars.ts`: Configures the structure of sidebars 
in the documentation section.
  - `docusaurus.config.ts`: Main configuration file 
for customizing and managing Docusaurus behavior.
  - `build/`: Generated after running the `npm run build` command. 
Contains the static website files ready for deployment.

New content can be added as follows:

  - Add new documentation files to the `docs/` folder.
  - Add new blog posts to the `blog/` folder. 
No additional configuration is required.

## Deployment

This website is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages 
using a prepared GitHub Actions workflow. 
Whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, 
the workflow builds the site and publishes it 
  — no manual deployment steps are required.
